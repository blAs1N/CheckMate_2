# CheckMate 2
This is where I store thing that My second game project, 'CheckMate'.  
The project begins on December 26 in 2018.  
It was discontinued on January 23, 2019.  
Because it is for new study. (UE4)  
Language uses 'C++' and render as 'Gdiplus'.  
The difference from the first project is that I created a framework that was based on, and I separated it from the game logic, and I applied some of the game programming patterns.
