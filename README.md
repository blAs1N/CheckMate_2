# CheckMate 2
This is where I store thing that My second big game project, 'CheckMate'.  
The project begins on December 26 in 2018 and currently in progress.  
Language uses 'C++' and render as 'Gdiplus'.  
The difference from the first project is that we created a framework that was based on, and we separated it from the game logic, and we applied some of the game programming algorithms.
