# CheckMate 2
This is where I store thing that My second game project, 'CheckMate'.  
The project begins on December 26 in 2018 and currently in progress.  
Language uses 'C++' and render as 'Gdiplus'.  
The difference from the first project is that I created a framework that was based on, and I separated it from the game logic, and I applied some of the game programming patterns.
